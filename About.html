				<p>I was actually on the career path to becoming an engineer. I like science, and I love being creative. The starving artist stereotype was all I had to go on when thinking of a future for myself. I had never actually been interested in graphic design until a few days before my second year of university. 

				<br><br>In university, I excelled in engineering courses, but one class and teacher changed my future. This electronics teacher loved electronics—all the AC, DC, and High voltage engineering stuff made him excited. I looked at him and thought, ‘I will never be that excited about engineering.’ From that moment on, I could imagine a dreary gray future with wires and machines around me. Yuck! So I began researching the graphic design industry to ensure it wasn’t a dying industry—ha! I visited designers and quickly fell in love with the fact that a creative individual could make a living being creative.</p>
