		<h2>Hypotheses:</h2>
		<ol>
		  <li>The EcoQuest board game creates a new, easily understandable language for players, serving as a gateway to introduce climate change terminology and concepts in an accessible manner.</li>
		  <li>Board games inherently carry a positive impact, potentially facilitating the communication of serious issues like climate change. Utilizing games as a medium may open new channels for engaging and educating players about climate change.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>Overview:</h2>
		<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Educate and inspire action on climate change through gamification.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Methodology:</strong> Qualitative assessment of game effectiveness through pre- and post-gameplay questionnaires and ethnographic observations.</p>

		<h2>Game Components:</h2>
		<ul>
		  <li><strong>Game Board:</strong> Features a world map, guiding players through climate-related challenges.</li>
		  <li><strong>Tokens:</strong> Represent players on the board.</li>
		  <li><strong>Challenge Cards:</strong> Pose climate-related questions for players to answer.</li>
		  <li><strong>Resource Cards:</strong> Provide advantages like bypassing challenges.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>How to Play:</h2>
		<p>Players move tokens across the board, answering challenge questions and earning points. They encounter opportunities to draw Resource Cards for advantages. Negative Point cards deduct points for certain actions.</p>
		
		<h2>Study Design:</h2>
		<p>Qualitative approach with pre- and post-gameplay interviews. Data collected on players' understanding of climate change and motivation for action.</p>
		
		<h2>Feedback and Suggestions:</h2>
		<p>Players suggested clearer instructions, more practical challenge questions, and a simplified answer system. Positive feedback on the game's thought-provoking and educational aspects was received.</p>
		
		<h2>Evaluation:</h2>
		<p>Players demonstrated enhanced understanding of climate change concepts and increased motivation for action after playing EcoQuest.</p>
